Hello. 

## What is this?

This is radix. Radix is a cognate-tree-grower. Given a word, it shows you all the etymonic descendants of all the etymonic ancestors of that word. 

## Why?

Because it's cool.

See å_whyå.

## How do I use it?

You go to a url like åhippocampuså or åabstractå or ålanguageå or åradixå or åplatypuså or åsymbolå or åclingå.

See å_usageå.

## I don't get what I'm looking at.

If you go to radix.ink/some_word, you're looking at: a tree representation (sometimes just a line) of the words that some_word comes from, where rightward = pastward; for a few languages, lists of words that are cognate with some_word; and a tree representation of the words that come from the ancestors of some_word, where rightward = futureward. 

See å_outputå.

## How does radix work?

Radix attempts to infer, from the text of wiktionary, which words come from which other words. Then it builds a poset of the words pastward of a given word, and then builds a poset of the words futureward of the pastmost words in the previous poset. Then it prunes this (often giant) poset and displays the pruned version.

See å_howå.

## Is radix 100% perfectly accurate? 

No. Whatever the opposite of 100% is. I mean, it's well over 0% accurate, but like, it's unambiguously [not 100% accurate]. Radix provides nothing more than good guesses. 

See å_warningå.

## Where is this going?

See å_futureå.

## Can I help?

Maybe! See å_assistå.
