## Word elements

This is an example of a word element:

@@GRAM thing, en@@

A word element represents a word.
The first dimmer part is the language of the word, sometimes shortened, in this case "English"⟶"En".
The second part is the text of the word itself, in this case "thing". 

Some word elements will also show a definition:

@@GRAM *bʰréh₂tēr, ine-pro@@

The asterisk * means that the word is [reconstructed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Reconstructed_terms). 

You can change the appearance of word elements in å_settingså. 

The controls that a word element provides are described in å_usageå. 


## Section: starting sense

This section gives info about the word that's being reported on.

The sense number says which sense is being reported on. A given word--a string of characters and the language--may have multiple underlying senses (homographs). E.g. the string "wind" in English has two unrelated meanings with unrelated etymons. A radix page reports on one sense. 

The etymology section from the wiktionary article on the starting word, if such exists, is (imperfectly) rendered.

## Section: pastward trunk

### Summary

The pastward trunk for a word shows the etymological ancestors of the word. If two words are linked together, the one on the right is the ancestor of the one on the left. E.g.: 

@@GRAM sing, en @@-@@GRAM singen, enm @@

In the pastward trunk, this would mean that English "sing" descends from Middle English "singen". The pastward trunk uses these abbreviations:

* @@jump button@@
* diamonds
* exclusions
* forks
* missing affixes

### The simple case 

The point of the pastward trunk is to show all the roots of the starting word. Further rightward on the screen corresponds to earlier in time. 

The simplest case is a linear trunk. See for example åsingå:

@@GRAM sing, en @@-@@GRAM singen, enm @@-@@GRAM singan, ang@@-@@GRAM \*singwan, gmw-pro@@-@@GRAM \*singwaną, gem-pro@@-@@GRAM \*sengʷʰ-, ine-pro@@

The white dashes like W-V indicate that the word W is a direct descendent of the word V, e.g. through inheritance (direct descent as a language developed over time) or borrowing (transplanting a word from one language to another).

### The ideal pastward trunk

*Ideally*, the pastward trunk is the set of senses that are pastward of the starting sense, going all the way back pastward as far as humanity's knowledge of proto-languages can go. 

In a spiritual sense, the pastward trunk is a tree. As we go pastward, we split exactly when a word was formed by combining two or more morphemes, e.g. in compounding or affixing. (It is possible to have a single word formed from "doublet morphemes", such as in åsightseeingå, but presumably (besides reduplication) this is very rare.) 

### Analytic diamonds

However, 


Mathematically, the pastward trunk is sort of a tree, but not really. It's closer to a [poset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set).

So a radix page for a PIE word will have a very short pastward trunk, but for a word in a modern language will often have a substantial pastward tree
