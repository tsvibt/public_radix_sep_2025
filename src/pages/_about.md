## Making of

when made

## Future

There are many improvements that could be made to radix. I don't know how much more work I'll do on it. Support (collaborators and/or money) would be very welcome. As of June 2024 server costs aren't covered. You can donate here: [paypal.me/TsviBT](paypal.me/TsviBT). If you're interested in collaborating, please email me at this gmail address: radixtsvibt

See å_futureå.
