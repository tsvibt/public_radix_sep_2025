## Color pickers

Click on the color pickers like @@dummyColorPicker@@ to set the display color for some corresponding aspect of radix's display. If a color has been modified away from the default, it is followed by a reset button that sets the color back to the default.

## General colors

Set the background color: @@settings_Colorpicker_background@@

Set the regular text color: @@settings_Colorpicker_textcolor@@

## Language elements

A word-like element on this page represents a language, and is used to set some setting for that language. That setting will apply to that language on other radix pages. The meaning of the fields is like: @@dummyLangElement@@

## Cognate languages

The pastward poset always shows (radix's best guess at) all the words that are pastward of the starting word. The futureward poset, however, is in many cases very big. Instead of showing the whole thing, radix restricts to words that are from some small subset of Indo-European languages, and words that are necessary to show how those words are related to the starting word. See å_outputå. 

The settings here are to select which languages will show up on the leaves of the futureward poset. So for example if Sanskrit is selected, and you go to a page for a word with a Sanskrit cognate, that cognate will show up. But if Sanskrit isn't selected here, then the Sanskrit cognate won't show up (unless there's another cognate that descends from it, and that is from a selected language).

## Colors for languages

Click on the color picker like @@dummyColorPicker@@ next to a language to set the display color for the text of words in that language. The language name and the definitions of the word are displayed on either side of the word text, colored with a dimmed version of the color for the word text.
