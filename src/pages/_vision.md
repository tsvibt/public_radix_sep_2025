## vision

browser / control panel / analytics engine for the world's languages. (following R.M.W. Dixon,  actual lingusts should spend their time and resources documenting dying languages! but programmers can do this thing) wiktionary should be the goald standard for dictionary-like functions, ie. functions focused on single words and their individual connections; radix for functions that involve patterns in many words. since wiktionary is the ground truth for radix and radix isn't anything without wiktionary, most effort should go to wikt; my hope is that radix would show what possibilities there are


since i'm not a linguist, i have no idea what other tools there are, and what tasks lingusits would want to do . 
all i know is
* wiktionary is the best integrated dictionary and will continue to be
* there's a bunch of stuff one might want to *view nicely* that comes from analyzing wiktionary, but that wiktionary doesn't provide (and that it should't distract itself with). 


* lots of cool stuff we can think of. random examples:
   * on the page for a word W, if you click on another word V, you see a poset that's just the intersection of the pastward poset of W and the pastward poset of V. in other words, it shows why W and V are related.
   * given a root/word, show the semantic groups of descendats. (would ned automatic meaning matching... llms)
   * given a word W in language L1 and anothre language L2, find words in L2 that share etymon/s with W and are closest in meaning, giving "sememic/morphemic/etymonic renderings" between languages. e.g. Wahrscheinlichkeit -> aver-shine-like-hood





* conjugations
* diamonds?
* alternate forms. misspellings, alt forms, rare forms
